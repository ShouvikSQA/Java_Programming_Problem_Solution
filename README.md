## Project Summery -
 Here I Have solved 12 basic level Programming Problem Using Java

 ## Problem Description and Soltutions -
   ## Questions
   ### Question 1
   -  Here is the 10 students CGPA [3.50, 3.52, 3.43, 3.63, 3.48, 3.32, 3.30, 3.60, 3.86, 3.75]
   - Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score. (without sorting, use linear searching algorithm)
   #### Solution Approch : 
    ** Here I have Taken one variable For the max value (max1) and another For the second max value (max1). Then Loop Through the whole array and updated Those variables.**
    ** When the value from the array was Greater the nax1 , update max1 . When the array value is smaller than max1 , but greater than max2 , Just update max2 with array value. **
   ### Question 2
   -  Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA (don’t use Arrays.sort() method, do it programmatically)
   ### Question 3
   -  Take a CGPA as user input. Now from the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm
      
  ### Question 4
   - Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.

  ### Question 5
   - Write a program that will break down the amount and count notes for any given amount. Here is the notes in the given array:    
notes=[1000,500,200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1]

   ### Question 6
   - Write a program that will give following output:

  ### Question 7
   - Take input as height of 10 babies in cm. Now find out the 2 lowest height of babies. (Don’t use Arrays.sort() method)
  ### Question 8
  - Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant from the given string
  ### Question 9 
  - Find the number of occurrences of characters in a String
   ### Question 10
   - Print the  numbers which are not duplicate from the given array. 
numbers=[1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 7]
  ### Question 11
  - Remove Vowels from a String
   ### Question 12
   - A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount? [Extract the digits from the paragraph and calculate the price]
